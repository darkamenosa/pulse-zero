# Pulse Zero v0.2.1 - Fix Summary

## Problem
After running the pulse_zero generator, Rails server failed to start with error:
```
uninitialized constant Pulse (NameError)
```

## Root Cause
The Pulse module wasn't being loaded when the Rails initializer ran because:
1. The lib directory wasn't properly configured in Rails autoload paths
2. The generator had an `add_pulse_to_autoload_paths` method but wasn't calling it
3. The initializer was trying to configure Pulse before it was loaded

## Solution
1. **Added `setup_autoload_paths` method** to the generator execution flow
2. **Made initializer defensive** by checking `if defined?(Pulse)` before configuration
3. **Simplified autoload setup** to just ensure lib is in autoload paths (Rails handles the rest)
4. **Removed conditional engine loading** from pulse.rb template (not needed with proper autoloading)

## Changes Made
1. `install_generator.rb`:
   - Added `setup_autoload_paths` method that calls `add_pulse_to_autoload_paths`
   - Simplified `add_pulse_to_autoload_paths` to just configure autoload_lib

2. `config/initializers/pulse.rb.tt`:
   - Wrapped configuration in `if defined?(Pulse)` check
   - Added warning message if Pulse not loaded

3. `lib/pulse.rb.tt`:
   - Removed `require "pulse/engine" if defined?(Rails::Engine)` line
   - Rails autoloading handles this automatically

## Usage
Install the updated gem:
```bash
gem install pulse_zero-0.2.1.gem
```

Run the generator:
```bash
rails generate pulse_zero:install
```

The generator will now:
1. Ensure lib is in Rails autoload paths
2. Generate all Pulse files
3. Configure the initializer defensively
4. Rails will properly load Pulse module on startup

## Verification
After running the generator, you should be able to:
1. Start Rails server without errors
2. See Pulse module loaded: `rails console` then `Pulse.config`
3. Use real-time broadcasting features
